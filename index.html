    <p class="text" id="related"><a href="http://www.poochhotel.com/">Pooch Hotel</a> is a similar themed website to this one. It's a pet hotel website! It includes a lot of meta and script tags and of course CSS. I like the fact that it's so nicely styled and structured in terms of layout and architecture and even though there is a lot of information on a single page navigating in it is very intuitive. I like all the interactivity it includes as well.</p>
